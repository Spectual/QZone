                         QZone - A Location Based Survey Platform 
                                                                    Team: Yifei Bao, Zhenyang Qian, Xuetong Fu 
                                                                      Github: https://github.com/Spectual/QZone 
                         
                        1. App Concept & Primary Use Case 
                         
                        QZone is a next-generation mobile survey platform developed in Kotlin for Android. It aims to improve the 
                        survey experience by connecting survey creators (researchers, marketers, etc.) with a diverse and 
                        engaged user base through a geo-targeted reward system. 
                         
                        The process is simple: users open the app to find a list of nearby surveys, complete them for points, and 
                        redeem those points for tangible rewards. For instance, after leaving a store, a user might get a push 
                        notification to review their shopping experience in exchange for points. 
                         
                        QZone's mission is to transform the traditionally tedious task of filling out surveys into a fast, engaging, 
                        and valuable experience for both participants and researchers. 
                         
                         
                        2. Target Users & Problem Being Solved  
                         
                        Target Users: 
                              -     Survey Participants (App Users): Students, young professionals, and any individual interested in 
                                    sharing their opinions for rewards. 
                              -     Survey Creators (Web Clients): Academic researchers, market research firms, product managers, 
                                    and small businesses needing targeted user feedback. 
                         
                        Problems: 
                              -     For Users: Current survey tools (e.g., web forms, email links) often provide a clunky, unengaging 
                                    user experience on mobile devices. The motivation to participate is low due to a lack of 
                                    immediate and valuable incentives. This leads to high drop-off rates and "survey fatigue." 
                              -     For Clients: It is challenging and expensive to acquire high-quality, geographically diverse data 
                                    samples. Existing platforms lack the ability to dynamically target users based on their real-world 
                                    location. 
                         
                        Our Solution: QZone addresses these issues by creating a centralized, mobile-first platform that 
                        gamifies the survey process with a rewards system and provides creators with a powerful geo-targeting 
                        tool, increasing both the quantity and quality of survey responses. 
                         
                        3. Planned Features 
                        We have divided our feature development into two phases: the core experience (MVP) and future 
                        enhancements (Stretch Goals). 
                         
                        3.1 Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - The Core Experience 
                         
                        Onboarding & Authentication: Effortless user registration and login, including third-party support for 
                        Google, Meta, and X to minimize friction. 
                        Location-Based Survey Feed: Use the device's GPS to fetch and display a list of surveys relevant to the 
                        user's current area. This is the central feature of our app. 
                        Reward & Points System: Users earn a base number of points for every completed survey, with the 
                        potential for bonus points set by the survey creator. 
                        Multimedia Survey Interface: A native, intuitive interface for answering various question types, with 
                        support for embedded text, images, audio, and video content.

                              -     Shake-to-Refresh: Utilize the gyroscope sensor to allow users to refresh their survey feed with a 
                                    simple shake gesture. 
                              -     In-App Reward Redemption: A built-in store where users can redeem their points for digital gift 
                                    cards, coupons, or other rewards. 
                         
                        Accessibility Features:  
                        We implement accessibility best practices, including specialized color themes for users with color 
                        blindness, dynamic font scaling, high contrast ratios option. 
                         
                        3.3 The Client-Side Platform (Conceptual Overview): 
                        We will also have a powerful, browser-based web portal for survey creators. While its development is not 
                        part of this Android project, its planned features include: 
                              -     Intuitive Survey Builder: A user-friendly interface for clients to publish surveys. 
                              -     AI-Assisted Creation & Templates: Offer pre-built templates for common use cases and 
                                    leverage AI to help generate questions based on simple prompts. 
                              -     Analytics Dashboard: Provide clients with a dashboard to monitor survey responses in 
                                    real-time, complete with data visualizations, charts, and exportable reports. 
                              -      
                        4. Technical Plan  
                         
                        Our architecture will be MVVM with Jetpack Compose, separating UI from logic. For example, a 
                        SurveyFeedViewModel will be responsible for calling a Repository to fetch surveys based on the user's 
                        location. This ViewModel will expose the survey list as an observable StateFlow. Our Compose UI will 
                        then subscribe to this flow and automatically re-render the list whenever the data changes, without 
                        needing manual UI updates. This declarative approach keeps our UI simple and state-driven, while 
                        allowing us to independently test the logic within our ViewModels, ensuring a robust and maintainable 
                        application. 
                         
                        External APIs: Google Identity Services, Firebase Authentication / Firestore, Google Maps SDK for 
                        Android. 
                        Onboard Sensors:GPS / Network Location, Gyroscope, Camera API, Microphone API 
                        Data Storage: Proto DataStore(local data caching) 
                         
                        5. Navigation Map 
                        Onboarding: Splash Screen -> Login/Register Screen (with social login options) -> Profile Setup. 
                        Main Interface: 
                              -     Home (Survey Feed): The default screen. A scrollable list of available surveys nearby. 
                              -     Map View (Stretch Goal): An interactive map showing survey locations. 
                              -     Rewards: A screen displaying the user's point balance and the reward redemption store. 
                              -     Profile: User profile, settings, and survey history. 
                              -     Survey Flow: Select Survey from Feed -> Survey Detail Page -> Survey Interface (questions) -> 
                                    Completion & Reward Confirmation. 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
                         
                        6. Team Collaboration Plan & Responsibilities 
                        As a collaborative team of three, we will share all design and architecture decisions. To ensure progress, 
                        we have assigned primary focus areas, but we will all contribute to the entire codebase through pair 
                        programming and code reviews.
