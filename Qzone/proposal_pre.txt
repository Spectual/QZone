    Product Introduction
                                  QZone  is  a  next-generation  mobile 
                                  survey  platform  developed  in  Kotlin  for 
                                  Android.  It  aims  to  improve  the  survey 
                                  experience by connecting survey creators 
                                  (researchers,  marketers,  etc.)  with  a 
                                  diverse and engaged user base through a 
                                  geo-targeted reward system.
                                  The process is simple: users open the app 
                                  to find a list of nearby surveys, complete 
                                  them for points, and redeem those points 
                                  for tangible rewards. 
                                  For instance, after leaving a store, a user 
                                  might  get  a  push  notification  to  review 
                                  their shopping experience in exchange for 
                                  points.
     What is the problem?
         For Users:                                              For Clients: 
         Current survey tools (e.g., web                         It is challenging and 
         forms, email links) often                               expensive to acquire 
         provide a clunky, unengaging                            high-quality, geographically 
         user experience on mobile                               diverse data samples. 
         devices. The motivation to                              Existing platforms lack the 
         participate is low due to a lack                        ability to dynamically target 
         of immediate and valuable                               users based on their 
         incentives. This leads to high                          real-world location.

                          Risks and open questions
                          ● Points-based incentives may induce cheating and 
                           low-quality responses—anti-abuse measures and the 
                           cost model need validation 
                          ● GPS-based location may affect battery life and cpu 
                           performance and have potential privacy and security 
                           problems.
